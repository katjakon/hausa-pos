# Hausa Part-of-Speech Tagging in a Low-Resource Scenario
This project is for my Bachelor thesis at the University of Potsdam for which I investigated automatic POS Tagging in Hausa by assuming that no annotated data is available. Instead, I utilized parallel sentences in Englisch, French, Arabic and German to induce word classes. <br>

## Notebooks
For various aspects of this work, I made use of Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab. This includes the word alignment, tagging of the source languages and training the tagging models. They can be found in the directory `notebooks`.
